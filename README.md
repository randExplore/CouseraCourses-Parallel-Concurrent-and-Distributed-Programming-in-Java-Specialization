# Parallel-Concurrent-and-Distributed-Programming-in-Java-Specialization

This repository is my self-learning solutions for the Cousera courses on [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed 
Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp) 
provided by Prof. Vivek Sarkar from the Rice University.

The specialization courses contain three parts:

1. [Parallel Programming in Java](/1_Parallel%20programming%20in%20Java/ReadMe.md)
2. [Concurrent Programming in Java](/2_Concurrent%20programming%20in%20Java/ReadMe.md)
3. [Distributed Programming in Java](/3_Distributed%20programming/ReadMe.md)

Each section contains four mini-projects,where the mini-project0 is the testing file for Java environment, which 
applies Maven for the project building and testing. Details for the Java environment setup can be found on the course
website.

All the project files are from the Cousera website, where only solutions for each mini projects are written by me. You
are free to use/modify the solution posted in this repository, but you may need to follow the Honor Codes and Rules
required by the Cousera website.
